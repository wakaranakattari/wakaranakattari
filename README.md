### 🧠 About Me

I focus on building **modern, high-performance, and actually useful** web applications.

I’m not just interested in "making things work" —  
I care about how systems behave under pressure, how interfaces feel, and how technology scales over time.

Things that matter to me:

- ⚡ Software that feels instant  
- 🎯 UI/UX that respects human attention  
- 🧩 Architecture that doesn’t collapse as projects grow  
- 🌐 The browser as a serious computing platform  

I’m especially drawn to **graphics in the browser**, low-level web capabilities, and exploring how far we can push the runtime itself.

### 🧭 Philosophy

The browser is not a limitation.  
It is the most universal runtime humanity has ever built.

We don’t “make websites” anymore —  
we build platforms, tools, editors, engines, and environments that run everywhere.

I believe:

- The web is the closest thing we have to a global operating system  
- Performance is not optimization — it is respect  
- UI is not decoration — it is communication  
- Complexity is easy; simplicity is engineering  
- Good tools expand human capability  
- Technology should reduce chaos, not amplify it  

If something can run in the browser — it should.

### 🌙 Outside of Code

- I like working at night  
- I read books  
- I believe the future belongs to modern technology — and reasonable people
